    <h1>Purposes of this assignment</h1>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Give you some experience with file input and output.</li>
      <li>Give you experience with string processing.</li>
      
    </ul>
    
    <h1>General idea of the assignment</h1>
    <p>HTML is the language of the web. When you open a page in your browser,
    your browser gets a plain (unformatted) text file, with an <code>.html</code>
    (or sometimes <code>.htm</code>) extension. This file contains both text and
    commands to format that text. Sometimes it isn't very neat. Your job is to
    &quot;tidy&quot; it up and produce the equivalent<code> .html</code> file, but
    which is properly indented and does not contain excessively long lines.</p>
    <p>Put your program on a file named <code>tidyHTML.py</code>. Your program
    should have a method named <code>main</code>. When executed, <code>main</code>
    should ask for the name of an HTML file, tidy it up, and (after some other file
    manipulations) put the result back on the same file. The extra file
    manipulations, described below, should prevent a bad program from accidentally
    destroying its input file. </p>
    
    <h1>What you need to know about HTML</h1>
    <p>HTML consists of text, most of which you will see on the screen, and
    tags, which you won't see, but which affect how things are formatted. There are
    two kinds of tags: Grouping tags, which have both a <span
    class="definiendum">start tag</span> and an <span class="definiendum">end
    tag</span> with enclosed text, and <span class="definiendum"><em>empty content
    tags</em></span>.</p>
    <p>Grouping tags have the syntax <code>&lt;<em>tagname</em>&gt;<em>enclosed
    text</em>&lt;/<em>tagname</em>&gt;</code>, for example,
    <code>&lt;strong&gt;word&lt;/strong&gt;</code> will make the
    <strong>word</strong> bold. After the tagname there may be whitespace followed
    by other information, for example, <code>&lt;span
    class=&quot;head&quot;&gt;<em>enclosed text</em>&lt;/span&gt;</code>. Tags are
    case-insensitive, so for example, <code>&lt;Strong&gt;<em>enclosed
    text</em>&lt;/sTrOnG&gt;</code> is legal. Tagnames consist <em>only</em> of
    letters--no digits or other characters.</p>
    <p>If a <code>&lt;</code> occurs in an HTML document, and the next character
    is a letter, it's a tag. But if the next character is not a letter, the
    <code>&lt;</code> is just another text character, not part of a tag.</p>
    <p>An example of an empty content tag is <code>&lt;hr&gt;</code>, which just
    draws a horizontal line. Standalone tags are sometimes written with a following
    slash, as <code>&lt;hr/&gt;</code> or <code><nobr>&lt;hr /&gt;</nobr></code>.
    </p>
    <p>Grouping tags may be nested. For example, to make
    <strong><em>word</em></strong> both bold and italic, the HTML might be
    <code>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;word&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>. Grouping
    tags may also be <em>incorrectly</em> nested, as in <code>&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&g
    t;word&lt;/strong&gt;</code><code>&lt;/em&gt;</code>. I will give you some rules
    about what to do in the simplest cases of bad nesting, but most of the time
    there isn't much you can reasonably do.</p>
    <p>The  empty content tags are: <code>area</code>, <code>base</code>,
    <code>basefont</code>, <code>br</code>, <code>col</code>, <code>frame</code>,
    <code>hr</code>, <code>img</code>, <code>input</code>, <code>isindex</code>,
    <code>link</code>, <code>meta</code>, and <code>param</code>; any other tag is a
    grouping tag. In general, you don't need to know what any of these tags do. One
    exception is <code>&lt;pre&gt;<em>enclosed text</em>&lt;/pre&gt;</code>, which
    says: Don't change the enclosed text in any way whatsoever; leave it exactly as
    is.</p>
    
    <h1>Details</h1>
    
    <h2>Overall process</h2>
    
    <ol>
    
      <li>Ask the user what <code>.html</code> (or <code>.htm</code>) file to
      read in.
      
        <ul>
          <li>See <a href="http://choorucode.com/2014/02/25/how-to-use-file-
          open-dialog-to-get-file-path-in-python/">How To Use Open File Dialog...</a> for
          how to do this nicely. </li>
          
        </ul>
        
      </li>
      <li>Copy the input file to a file of the same name, but with the
      <em>additional</em> extension <code>.bak</code>.</li>
      <li>Generate a name for the output file. The name should consist of a
      large random integer (use <code>random.randint(1, sys.maxint)</code>), with the
      <code>.html</code> extension.</li>
      <li>Read and process the input file, writing to the output file. You will
      probably find it simplest to read and process one line at a time, but it's also
      okay to read in the entire file.</li>
      <li>If the output file appears to have been written successfully, delete
      the original input file, and rename your output file to have the same name.
      Leave the <code>.bak</code> file in place (just in case). </li>
      
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Indentation</h2>
    <p>For each line:</p>
    
    <ul>
    
      <li>If the line contains <em>both</em> a start tag and  matching end tag,
      with any intervening tags properly nested, that part of the line is treated as
      just ordinary text; nothing special is done to it.

        </ul>
        
      </li>
      
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Case</h2>
    <p>All tag names should be lowercase. If they aren't, lowercase them. If
    there is any information in the tag after the tag name, leave it as is. </p>
    
    <h2>Lines and line length</h2>
    <p>There should be exactly one blank line before each of the following start
    tags: <code>head</code>, <code>body</code>, <code>h1</code>, <code>h2</code>,
    <code>h3</code>, <code>h4</code>, <code>h5</code>, <code>h6</code>. Other blank
    lines (unless they are inside a <code>pre</code> tag) should be deleted.</p>
    <p>There should be no whitespace (space or tab) at the end of any line,
    unless the whitespace is within a <code>pre</code> tag.</p>
    <p>Lines should be no longer than 80 characters (counting indentation). If a
    line is longer than 80 characters, find the last blank before the 80th character
    position, insert a newline character, and indent the new line the same amount as
    the original line. Since lines might be 200 or more characters in length, repeat
    this procedure as necessary until no line is longer than 80 characters (unless
    it is within a <code>pre</code> tag!).</p>
    
    <h2>Keeping track of nesting</h2>
    <p>If <code>tags</code> is a list,</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><code>tags.append(<em>string</em>)</code> will add
      <code><em>string</em></code> to the end of the list.</li>
      <li><code><em>string</em> = tags.pop()</code> will remove the last element
      from the list and assign it to <em><code>string</code></em>. It's an error if
      <code>tags</code> is the empty list.</li>
      <li><code>tags == []</code> will be True if the list is empty.</li>
      <li><code>tags[-1]</code> refers to the last element of the list.</li>
      
    </ul>
    <p>Lists provide an excellent way of keeping track of nesting. Start with an
    empty list; whenever you encounter a start tag, append it to the list. Whenever
    you encounter an end tag, compare it to the last thing in the list, and if it
    matches, pop it from the list. (If it doesn't match, the nesting is incorrect.)
    Empty content tags should not be put on the list.</p>
    
    <h2>Dealing with incorrect nesting</h2>
    <p>There's no good way. Seriously. Every browser does something
    different.</p>
    <p>The following approach should work well enough for our purposes. It is
    based on the assumption that the most common type of error is a missing end
    tag.</p>
    <p>If an end tag (call it &quot;E&quot;) doesn't match the last thing on the
    list of start tags, then insert an end tag for that start tag, and pop the start
    tag   from the list. If E still doesn't match, do it again. If, after inserting
    two end tags, E still doesn't match the last thing in the list, discard E. </p>
    
    <h1>Style</h1>
    <p>All the usual--meaningful variable names, spaces around binary operators
    (including <code>**</code>, which some of you haven't been putting spaces
    around), etc. Write a doc string for each function, and be sure to put your
    name, and your partner's name, in comments at the very top of the program. </p>
    <p>Your program should consist of a lot of little functions, not a few big
    functions. Functions should be of two types: Those that do input or output, and
    those that do computation. You should have good unit tests for every function
    that does computation.  (If you have just a few big functions, you will find
    unit testing very, very difficult!) </p>
    
    <h1>Grading</h1>
    <p>We won't have unit tests for your assignment, for the simple reason that
    I haven't told you exactly what your functions should be. Instead, I will try to
    write the program myself, and compare my output against yours. Hopefully, the
    results will be character-by-character identical!</p>
    <p>We will also be looking at your unit tests, to see whether they seem
    adequate. </p>
    
    <h1>Due date</h1>
    Turn your assignment in to <a
    href="https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1256416">Canvas</a> before <strong>6am
    Friday, September 26</strong>. Zip your program file and your test file
    together. This is a pair programming assignment, so you should decide which of
    you will turn it in (we don't want to grade two copies of the same program). Be
    sure to put <strong>both of your names</strong> in a comment right at the top of
    the program.
